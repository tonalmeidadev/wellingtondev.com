    biography: [
      `I was born and raised in São Paulo — SP, I'm 26 years old, full of energy and passion for what I do. I discovered in my teenage years that technology was for me when I enjoyed editing templates on Tumblr using HTML and CSS.`,
      `Throughout my career in technology, I explored other areas related to websites that allowed me to have a broad vision of architecture, development processes, and people. Besides coding, I worked on prototyping and redesigning interfaces, implemented SEO strategies, managed social media, and collaborated in management processes using the Scrum framework.`,
      `My goal is always to focus on the smallest details and create functional and responsive solutions where design, motion, interaction, and accessibility integrate seamlessly.`,
