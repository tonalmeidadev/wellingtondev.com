    biography: [
      `Based in São Paulo, Brazil, I'm a Front-end developer with over 3 years of experience. I'm passionate and energetic about my work. My first connection with coding was during my teenage years when I enjoyed editing Tumblr templates using HTML and CSS.`,
      `Throughout my career in technology, I explored other areas related to websites that allowed me to have a broad vision of architecture, development processes, and people. Besides coding, I worked on prototyping and redesigning interfaces, implemented SEO strategies, managed social media, and collaborated in management processes using the Scrum framework.`,
      `My goal is always to focus on the smallest details and create functional and responsive solutions where design, motion, interaction, and accessibility integrate seamlessly.`,
